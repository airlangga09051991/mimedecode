WHAT IS IT

   Mail users, especially in non-English countries, often find that mail
messages arrived in different formats, with different content types, in
different encodings and charsets. Usually this is good because it allows us to
use apropriate format/encoding/whatever. Sometimes, though, some unification is
desireable. For example, one may want to put mail messages into an archive,
make HTML indicies, run search indexer, etc. In such situations converting
messages to text in one character set and skipping some binary atachmetnts is
much desireable.

   Here is the solution - mimedecode.py.

   This is a program to decode MIME messages. The program expects one input
file (either on command line or on stdin) which is treated as an RFC822 mesage,
and decoded to stdout. If the file is not an RFC822 message it is just piped to
stdout one-to-one. If the file is a simple RFC822 message it is just decoded as
one part. If it is a MIME message with multiple parts ("attachments") all parts
are decoded. Decoding can be controlled by command-line options.
