WHAT IS IT

   Mail users, especially in non-English countries, often find that mail
messages arrived in different formats, with different content types, in
different encodings and charsets. Usually this is good because it allows us to
use appropriate format/encoding/whatever. Sometimes, though, some unification
is desirable. For example, one may want to put mail messages into an archive,
make HTML indices, run search indexer, etc. In such situations converting
messages to text in one character set and skipping some binary attachments is
much desirable.

   Here is the solution - mimedecode.py.

   This is a program to decode MIME messages. The program expects one input
file (either on command line or on stdin) which is treated as an RFC822
message, and decodes to stdout or an output file. If the file is not an RFC822
message it is just copied to the output one-to-one. If the file is a simple
RFC822 message it is decoded as one part. If it is a MIME message with multiple
parts ("attachments") all parts are decoded. Decoding can be controlled by
command-line options.

WHAT'S NEW in version 2.3.5 (2014-02-19)

   Decode "To" headers by default.

   Report test progress and success.

   Add tests for headers and parameters decoding.

   Add tests for passing (-b) and skipping (-i) message bodies.

WHAT'S NEW in version 2.3.4 (2014-02-11)

   Optimize recursive decoding.

   Fix a bug - decode message/rfc822 subparts.

WHAT'S NEW in version 2.3.3 (2014-02-02)
   Forbid filtering from console. When the program runs with stdin
   connected to the console it shows usage help.

   Fix a bug - option -o and no parameters.

WHAT'S NEW in version 2.3.2 (2014-02-01)
   Fix a bug - do not generate 'From ' headers in subparts.

   Add option --host.

   Add tests.

WHAT'S NEW in version 2.3.1 (2014-01-31)
   Update documentation.

WHAT'S NEW in version 2.3.0 (2014-01-30)
   Add option -o and output_file argument.

WHAT'S NEW in version 2.2.0 (2013-12-21)
   Rename __version__.py to mimedecode_version.py.

   Use setuptools.
